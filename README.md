### Goal and Value of the Application
The goal of this application is to provide users with a simple, easy-to-use interface for purchasing skincare products. 

### Usability Principles Considered
The interface provides users with the ability to filter based on their skin type and the type of product they would like to purchase, allowing for an efficient shopping experience. The interface also provide a means to sort the items by price and customers' ratings. Keeping in mind the typical mental model for these sorting methods, price is sorted from lowest to highest, and rating is sorted from highest to lowest. There is minimal text throughout the site, making it easy to find the important things: filtering/sorting criteria, essential product information, and the cart. Moreover, in order to prevent a need for excessive scrolling back and forth, products can be removed from the cart in the same location they are added. To that same end, the sorting/filtering capabilities were made to be always accessible by providing them in a fixed left sidebar. In that same sidebar, I provided a button that allows for all sorting/filtering criteria to be completely reset back to default. Finally, important accessbility considerations were made, such as providing alternative text and using high-contrast text/background colors in order to aid in readability.

### Organization of Components
My main component is the Index component, which simply provides the functionality for re-rendering the App when resetting
